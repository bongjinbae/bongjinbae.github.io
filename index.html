<h1>Hash-based signature scheme for blockchain</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
In these days, the security level of existing cryptographic algorithms is needed to be increased by the rapid development of Quantum computer and Quantum algorithms such as Shor¡¯s algorithm and Grover¡¯s algorithm. Some of existing cryptographic algorithms have vulnerabilities against Quantum algorithm. Especially, Blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin and ethereum on Cryptocurrency market use the ECDSA Digital Signature Algorithm which has vulnerabilities against Quantum algorithm. In this paper, applying the hash-based signature scheme which is one of post-quantum cryptography on the existing blockchain. The proposed method is using W-OTS(Winternitz One-Time Signature) on generating and verifying the signature of transaction and MSS(Merkletree Signature Scheme) to Merkle tree architecture on the blockchain. In the case of generating the signature of transaction based on the proposed method decreases time from 1/3 to 1/9, the proposed verification method on the signature of transaction decreases time about 1/5 and it can verify not only the merkle signature, but also the integrity of all transactions and check out whether block includes the verified transaction.
